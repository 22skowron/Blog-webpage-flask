# Web development capstone project - The Blog

A blog website which allows the owner to publish/update/delete articles. Also incorporates the Register/Login functionality. Logged in users can comment on the owner's posts. 
User credentials and articles' data are stored in a PostgreSQL database (passwords are ofc hashed).

The website was created during the [**Python Bootcamp course on Udemy**](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code "https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code").  
_All initial html, css and javascript files were provided by the tutor and come from the aforementioned Udemy course._  
**I am the author of all the code written in Python (_main.py, forms.py_).**

*\*Website is hosted on Render.com. As I am using the free plan, unfortunately, ~2 minutes are required for the server to set up (web hosting service will be changed soon).\**
